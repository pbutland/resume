## Overview

I am an experienced software developer with a wide variety of exposure in different aspects of software development, including requirements analysis, architecture and design, coding, testing, implementation, release and change management, and devops. My main specialities include being able to learn and understand new and complex systems extremely quickly allowing me to “hit the ground running” and become productive in as short a time as possible.

I constantly strive to pay meticulous attention to detail to ensure the correct solution is delivered on time and at the appropriate cost. Failing to understand user requirements is something that I believe is one of the most costly aspects of software development. Therefore, I always try where possible, to ensure that every stakeholder understands what will be developed for any particular part of a system before any development effort has been expended.

I also believe that the tools that a developer uses to provide software solutions (including which programming languages are used) are just that; tools. Programming languages and technologies come and go, so a good software developer should be able to pick up new tools and discard old tools easily where applicable. While it is important to recognise that certain tools are better suited to some problems than others, in my opinion, the main focus for a developer should be in understanding the system that they are developing and fully understanding the user requirements for that system. And to not get overly distracted with the specific technologies that should be used to achieve the end goal.
